The application will be a simple REST API server that will expose endpoints to allow accessing and manipulating ‘products’. The operations that our endpoint will allow include:

    Creating a new product,
    Updating an existing product,
    Deleting an existing product,
    Fetching an existing product, and
    Fetching a list of products.
